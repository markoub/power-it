  "prompt": "You are tasked with creating a professional presentation based on the following research:\n\n{\n  \"content\": \"# The Benefits of Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n## 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.\\n\\nThe primary goal of AI is to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, often doing so more efficiently, accurately, and at scale. While the concept has evolved significantly, the core idea remains empowering technology to understand, learn, and act based on data and patterns.\\n\\n## 2. Key Benefits and Concepts\\n\\nAI offers a wide range of benefits across various domains. Some of the most significant include:\\n\\n*   **Increased Efficiency and Automation:** AI excels at automating repetitive, mundane, or high-volume tasks that would be time-consuming or impossible for humans. This frees up human workers for more complex, creative, or strategic work.\\n*   **Improved Decision Making:** AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data far quicker and identify patterns or insights that humans might miss. This leads to more data-driven, informed, and often more accurate decisions.\\n*   **Enhanced Accuracy and Reduced Errors:** In tasks requiring precision and consistency, AI can significantly reduce human error. This is particularly critical in fields like manufacturing, data entry, and medical diagnosis.\\n*   **Personalization at Scale:** AI enables highly personalized experiences for individuals, whether it's tailored product recommendations, customized educational content, or personalized healthcare plans.\\n*   **Innovation and Discovery:** AI tools are accelerating research and development in various fields, from discovering new materials and drugs to identifying complex scientific phenomena.\\n*   **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** AI-powered technologies like voice assistants, image recognition for the visually impaired, and predictive text can enhance accessibility for people with disabilities.\\n*   **Enhanced Safety:** AI can improve safety in dangerous environments (e.g., autonomous inspection robots) or through predictive analysis (e.g., identifying potential equipment failures before they occur).\\n*   **Cost Reduction:** While initial investment can be high, AI automation and efficiency gains often lead to significant long-term cost savings.\\n\\n## 3. Historical Background\\n\\nThe concept of intelligent machines dates back centuries, but the field of AI was formally founded in **1956** at a workshop at Dartmouth College. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving, leading to systems like expert systems.\\n\\nProgress was often slow due to limited computing power and data. Periods known as \"AI winters\" occurred when funding and interest waned due to unmet expectations.\\n\\nThe resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to:\\n\\n*   **Massive increase in data availability** (Big Data).\\n*   **Significant advancements in computing power** (especially GPUs).\\n*   **Development of more sophisticated algorithms**, particularly in machine learning and deep learning.\\n\\nThis historical progression highlights how overcoming computational and data limitations has unlocked the practical benefits we see today.\\n\\n## 4. Current State and Applications\\n\\nAI is no longer confined to research labs; its benefits are being realized across almost every industry:\\n\\n*   **Healthcare:** AI assists in diagnosing diseases (e.g., analyzing medical images), discovering new drugs, personalizing treatment plans, and managing patient data.\\n*   **Finance:** Used for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, credit scoring, risk assessment, and personalized financial advice.\\n*   **Retail:** Powers recommendation engines, optimizes supply chains, manages inventory, and enhances customer service through chatbots.\\n*   **Manufacturing:** Enables predictive maintenance, quality control, robotic automation, and optimization of production processes.\\n*   **Transportation:** Fundamental to autonomous vehicles, optimizing logistics, and managing traffic flow.\\n*   **Customer Service:** Chatbots and virtual assistants handle inquiries, improving response times and availability.\\n*   **Agriculture:** AI helps optimize crop yields through data analysis on weather, soil, and plant health.\\n*   **Education:** Provides personalized learning experiences and automates administrative tasks.\\n\\nThese examples demonstrate how AI's ability to process data, learn, and automate is delivering tangible benefits today.\\n\\n## 5. Future Directions and Trends\\n\\nThe future of AI promises even greater benefits as the technology matures and becomes more integrated into society:\\n\\n*   **More Sophisticated Automation:** AI will automate increasingly complex tasks, potentially leading to significant shifts in workforce dynamics.\\n*   **Hyper-Personalization:** AI will enable even deeper levels of personalization in products, services, and experiences across all sectors.\\n*   **Solving Grand Challenges:** AI is expected to play a crucial role in addressing global issues like climate change, developing sustainable energy solutions, and curing complex diseases.\\n*   **Enhanced Human-AI Collaboration:** Future AI systems are likely to be designed to work more seamlessly alongside humans, augmenting capabilities rather than simply replacing tasks.\\n*   **Democratization of AI:** As AI tools become more accessible and user-friendly, their benefits will spread to smaller businesses and individuals.\\n*   **Advancements in Explainable AI (XAI):** Efforts to make AI decisions more transparent will build trust and enable its application in more critical areas.\\n\\nRealizing these future benefits will require continued research, ethical considerations, and careful implementation to ensure AI serves humanity positively.\\n\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier\",\n      \"title\": \"McKinsey: The economic potential of generative AI\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence\",\n      \"title\": \"IBM: What is Artificial Intelligence?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence\",\n      \"title\": \"Built In: What is AI?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-promise-of-ai-in-health-care-addressing-challenges-to-realize-the-value/\",\n      \"title\": \"Brookings: The promise of AI in health care\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nReview the research content carefully and follow these guidelines:\n\n1. If the research content contains specific instructions about:\n   - Exact slide content\n   - Specific number of slides\n   - Particular speaker notes\n   - Specific visual elements\n   - Slide organization or structure\n   - Any other precise details about the presentation\n\n   Follow these instructions closely as specified. Do not deviate too much from explicit instructions, only if you want to introduce more visual elements.\n\n2. If the research does not contain specific instructions:\n   Create approximately 6 slides for a professional presentation organized by sections.\n   \nIMPORTANT: You MUST use MULTIPLE DIFFERENT slide types. DO NOT default to using mostly 'Content' slides.\nPRIORITIZE using 'ContentImage', 'ImageFull', and '3Images' slides wherever possible to make the presentation visually engaging.\nAIM for no more than 30-40% of the main content slides (excluding Welcome/TOC/Section) to be of the plain 'Content' type.\n\nREQUIRED SLIDE TYPES (these MUST be included):- 'Welcome' as the FIRST slide with title, subtitle, and author\n- At least 2-3 'Section' slides to divide your content into logical sections\n- A mix of 'Content' and 'ContentImage' slides (prefer 'ContentImage')\n- At least one '3Images' or 'ImageFull' slide if the content suits visual presentation\n\nAvailable slide types:\n- 'Welcome': Opening slide with presentation title, subtitle and author name\n- 'Section': Section divider slide with section title\n- 'ContentImage': Content slide with text and an accompanying image (should be most of the slides)\n- 'Content': Standard content slide with bullet points\n- 'ImageFull': Slide with dominant image and smaller text field for explanation\n- '3Images': Slide with three images in grid layout, each with its own subtitle\n- 'ContentWithLogos': Content slide with bullet points and up to three company/product logos\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR 'ContentWithLogos' SLIDES:\n- Use the 'ContentWithLogos' slide type when discussing specific companies, products, technologies, tools, or services\n- You can include 1 to 3 logos per slide\n- For each logo, simply include the company or product name (e.g., \"Amazon AWS\", \"Microsoft\", \"Google Cloud\")\n- Do not include any URLs or placeholders; the actual logos will be fetched automatically\n\nThe presentation MUST follow this structure:\n- First slide MUST be a 'Welcome' slide that includes the presentation title, subtitle, and \"Marko Milosevic\" as the author\n- Content MUST be organized into sections, each STARTING with a 'Section' slide\n- Use 'ContentImage' slides for important points that would benefit from visual illustration\n- Use regular 'Content' slides for general material when you have too much text, and no suitable image (do not have too many slides with only text)\n- Use 'ImageFull' for topics that need visual emphasis\n- Use '3Images' for comparing multiple items visually\n- Use 'ContentWithLogos' whenever discussing specific companies, products, or technologies that have recognizable logos\n\nThe slides should be organized in clear sections (like \"Market Research\", \"Our Services\", \"Reference Cases\", etc.)\n\nREMEMBER: Use a VARIETY of slide types, prioritizing visual elements over plain text slides.\n\nFor each slide, ONLY provide the required fields based on its type, as follows:\n- Welcome slides: title, subtitle, author\n- Section slides: title\n- Content slides: title, content (MUST be a JSON array of strings, each string a bullet point)\n- ContentImage slides: title, subtitle, image, content (MUST be a JSON array of strings, each string a bullet point)\n- ImageFull slides: title, image, explanation\n- 3Images slides: title, image1, image2, image3, image1subtitle, image2subtitle, image3subtitle\n- ContentWithLogos slides: title, content (MUST be a JSON array of strings), logo1, logo2 (optional), logo3 (optional)\n\nWhen there are images, do not put placeholders, put the explanation what should be on the image.\nFor logos, simply put the company or product name (e.g., \"AWS\", \"Microsoft\", \"Google\") - the actual logo will be fetched.\n\nDO NOT include any fields not specifically listed for each slide type. For example, Welcome slides should NOT have a content field.\n\nNote: Do not include the fields 'notes' or 'visual_suggestions' in your response as these will be handled separately.\n\nFormat your response as a valid JSON object where:\n1. The root object has \"title\", \"author\", and \"slides\" properties\n2. Each slide has \"type\" and \"fields\" properties\n3. The \"fields\" property contains only the fields allowed for that slide type, AND the \"content\" field, when present, MUST be a JSON array of strings.\n\nMake sure your JSON is valid with proper escaping of quotes and special characters. \nEach slide should only have the 'type' and 'fields' properties.\nThe 'fields' property should only contain the fields specified for that slide type.\n"
